<p><strong>How do I know if I placed my order correctly? </strong></p>



<p>Upon successful completion of order, order confirmation e-mail and SMS will be sent to your registered email id and phone number containing your order details.</p>



<p><strong>How are the fruits and vegetables weighed? </strong></p>



<p>Every fruit and vegetable varies a little in size and weight. You can order any pack size/weight available on the website. While you shop, we will show an estimated weight and price for everything on per kilogram. At the time of billing, we pack the closest pack size/weight and charge you for the actual weight/each of the item. E.g. If you order 1 Kg Apple Red Delicious, we will try to pack exact 1 Kg or a weight closest to 1 Kg. If actual weight is 987 gm, we will bill you for 987 gm and not 1 Kg.</p>



<p><strong>How do I make changes to my order?</strong></p>



<p>Currently, there is no provision for changing the order once placed. In case of any urgent requirement, please call our customer support team &amp; we will assist you with best possible option.</p>
