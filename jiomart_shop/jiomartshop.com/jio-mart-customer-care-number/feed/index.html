					<description><![CDATA[My prepaid order no. 15939541739146480W booked on 5th July 2020 which was supposed to get delivered on 7th July 2020 has not been delivered yet.
There is no response from jiomart customer care. I had paid Rs 4367 to book the order. Yesterday they processed refund of Rs 1551 without informing me. I don&#039;t know whether they will deliver booked items or process for refund again. At least 12 email sent to cs@jiomart.com to know the status in this regard, but not a single reply got from the customer care. It was expected   from a reputed brand like Reliance, harassing people in this way. Helpline land number also not working. Very unfortunate and hopeless.]]></description>
